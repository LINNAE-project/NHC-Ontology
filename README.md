# DSW-NHC

The DSW-NHC (Darwin Core Semantic Web for Natural History Collections) is an extension of the Darwin-SW ontology used to semantically describe present-day biodiversity data. The DSW-NHC is an application ontology that extends the Darwin-SW and serves to structure the entities in natural history collections through semantic annotation. It connects to digitized manuscript scans with the Web Annotation Data Model<sup>1</sup>.
