# DSW-NHC

Large archival collections of historical biodiversity expeditions are housed in natural history museums throughout the world. They should serve as rich sources of data for cultural history and biodiversity research, but disclosing their content remains challenging. Although many collections have been digitised, they exist as poorly catalogued specimens and images of unstructured, non-standardised, hand-written text and drawings. Moreover, they are often written in multiple languages, referring to historical place names and outdated taxonomic classifications. Efforts to transcribe the hand-written text can make the content accessible. We, however, argue that the content should be semantically modelled and interlinked to facilitate research.  The DSW-NHC, an extension of the Darwin-SW ontology, is a semantic model that serves to structure the entities in natural history collections. 
%Standards for describing present-day biodiversity data and general historical archive collections exist on the Semantic Web. We propose a model which combines and enriches these standards to enable the semantic annotation of natural history collections.
