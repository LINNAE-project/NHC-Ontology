# DSW-NHC

The DSW-NHC, an extension of the Darwin-SW ontology, is a semantic model that serves to structure the entities in natural history collections. It connects to digitized manuscript scans with the Web Annotation Data Model[^footnote].
%Standards for describing present-day biodiversity data and general historical archive collections exist on the Semantic Web. We propose a model which combines and enriches these standards to enable the semantic annotation of natural history collections.
